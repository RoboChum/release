# Summary
Chat to various helpful uncensored characters from the privacy of your own computer. No data leaves your computer. Easy install and out-of-the-box usage. There will always be a free version with basic features. Other features may be added that require payment to support development of the app.

# Key features
* üîí Total privacy - no data is gathered on personal usage or to train models. All your conversations are temporary
* üóΩ Uncensored characters - chat about whatever you want with no restrictions (you're responsible for following any laws in your country)
* üöÄ Easy install and usage
* ‚ÜîÔ∏è Available on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS)

# Use cases
* You have a powerful machine (e.g. a gaming machine with a good graphics card, Mac M-series, etc.) and:
  * are concerned about **privacy** -> None of your data leaves your machine. None of your data is logged anywhere locally (chat activity is redacted). There's no telemetry to track your usage (other than GitHub release download count). The app will work offline - new release checking won't work but everything is else is 100% functional. Use the portable version if you don't want a permanent install
  * aren't a technical person and want to see how well these smaller AI models run on your machine -> All Characters are pre-configured and tuned for the default model installed, so they _should_ return good results in most cases. The default model is a good all-rounder and was tested against many other options - there's no real need to find a different one. Other than the **Custom** character, there's very little tweaking that can be done since it's very easy to reduce the quality of interactions if you aren't experienced in prompt engineering

# Requirements
* Fast CPU with a minimum of 8GB RAM **or** GPU with a minimum of 8GB VRAM - fast enough for a 7 billion parameter model. If you're not sure, just give it a try - the worst that will happen is the characters will speak too slowly for your taste
* ~5GB disk space - the app is small, the models are the large part

# Demo
The below was run on an **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti** with **8GB VRAM** graphics card. Performance will vary based on your **GPU** or **CPU**.

# Built-in characters
* **Assistant** - general purpose
* **Custom** - provide whatever instructions you want
* **Editor** - writing specialist
* **Life Coach** - helps with personal goals
* **Roleplay** - another human to talk to
* **Searcher** - attach files and query them (supports `.csv`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.md`, `.tsv`, `.txt`)
* **Stay Positive** - cheers you up

# Useful command line options
* `--device <cpu|gpu>` - force app to use either **cpu** or **gpu**. Default is to try **gpu**, then fallback to **cpu**
* `--enable-debug-mode` - enable file logs and output user / bot input and output text. Use this with caution since it will contain your conversations

# Known issues
In general, the app is bug free (please submit any issues via [robochum@outlook.com](mailto:robochum@outlook.com) or through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/RoboChum/release/issues)). However:
* Alpha currently uses a self-signed cert. In addition the app is packaged into an executable which scares virus checkers. This combination of self-signed cert + compressed executable means your virus checker _may_ block the executable from running. Currently you'll have to trust me that the app is safe while waiting for a proper code signing certificate
* **Searcher** character does not support `.pdf` files. Adding support for this bloats the app size massively, so not included for now

# Future releases
* More customisation options
* Support for files across multiple characters
* Voice input / output
* Image generation / sending
* Video generation
* Finer grained memory / privacy options
* API support for power users
* Remote access for power users
* Anything else based on user feedback üòÅ
