# Summary
Chat to various helpful uncensored characters from the privacy of your own computer. No data leaves your computer. Easy install and out-of-the-box usage. There will always be a free version with basic features. Other features may be added that require payment to support development of the app.

# Key features
* 🔒 Total privacy - no data is gathered on personal usage or to train models. All your conversations are temporary
* 🗽 Uncensored characters - chat about whatever you want with no restrictions (you're responsible for following any laws in your country)
* 🚀 Easy install and usage

# Requirements
* Fast CPU **or** GPU with a minimum of 8GB VRAM - fast enough for a 7 billion parameter model. If you're not sure just give it a try, the worst that will happen is the characters will speak too slowly for your taste
* ~5GB disk space

# Demo
* TBD

# Future releases
* More customisation options
* Voice input / output
* Image generation / sending
* Finer grained memory / privacy options
* API support
* Anything else based on user feedback 😁
