# Summary
Chat to various helpful uncensored characters from the privacy of your own computer. No data leaves your computer. Easy install and out-of-the-box usage. There will always be a free version with basic features. Other features may be added that require payment to support development of the app.

# Key features
* üîí Total privacy - no data is gathered on personal usage or to train models. All your conversations are temporary
* üóΩ Uncensored characters - chat about whatever you want with no restrictions (you're responsible for following any laws in your country)
* üöÄ Easy install and usage
* ‚ÜîÔ∏è Available on multiple platforms (Windows, macOS)

# Requirements
* Fast CPU with a minimum of 8GB RAM **or** GPU with a minimum of 8GB VRAM - fast enough for a 7 billion parameter model. If you're not sure, just give it a try - the worst that will happen is the characters will speak too slowly for your taste
* ~5GB disk space - the app is small, the models are the large part

# Demo
The below was run on an **NVIDIA GeForce RTX 3070 Ti** with **8GB VRAM** graphics card. Performance will vary based on your **GPU** or **CPU**.

# Built-in characters
* **Assistant** - general purpose
* **Custom** - provide whatever instructions you want
* **Editor** - writing specialist
* **Life Coach** - helps with personal goals
* **Roleplay** - another human to talk to
* **Searcher** - attach files and query them (supports `.csv`, `.docx`, `.xlsx`, `.md`, `.tsv`, `.txt`)
* **Stay Positive** - cheers you up

# Useful command line options
* `--device <cpu|gpu>` - force app to use either **cpu** or **gpu**. Default is to try **gpu**, then fallback to **cpu**
* `--enable-debug-mode` - enable file logs and output user / bot input and output text. Use this with caution since it will contain your conversations

# Known issues
In general, the app is bug free (please submit any issues via [robochum@outlook.com](mailto:robochum@outlook.com) or through [GitHub Issues](https://github.com/RoboChum/release/issues)). However:
* Alpha currently uses a self-signed cert. In addition the app is packaged into an executable which scares virus checkers. This combination of self-signed cert + compressed executable means your virus checker _may_ block the executable from running. Currently you'll have to trust me that the app is safe while waiting for a proper code signing certificate
* **Searcher** character does not support `.pdf` files. Adding support for this bloats the app size massively, so not included for now

# Future releases
* More customisation options
* Support for files across multiple characters
* Voice input / output
* Image generation / sending
* Video generation
* Finer grained memory / privacy options
* API support for power users
* Remote access for power users
* Anything else based on user feedback üòÅ
